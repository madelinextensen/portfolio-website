        <h2>Context and Purpose</h2>
        <p>According to the National Financial Educators Council, the average financial literacy score
          for youth aged 10-14 is 57% and 63% for ages 15-18. Since youth start interacting with money
          at younger and younger ages, how can we make learning about finances more appealing and
          create more financially literate youth and young adults?
          The goal was to create an e-wallet application that teaches teens financial literacy in an
          interactive, entertaining way. We want to encourage youth to take the initiative to manage their
          money and make healthy financial decisions.</p>

          <p>UX/UI Designer</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Timeline</h3>
          <p>May - November 2021</p>

          <h3>Toolbox</h3>

      <div>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>When it came to users of e-wallets, there are a few problems:</p>
        <div>
          <h3>No financial literacy</h3>
          <p>Most users have difficulty in managing money due to a lack of financial knowledge and
            experience</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>No incentives</h3>
          <p>Existing financial apps don't make it fun or incentivize users to return</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Too many apps</h3>
          <p>Most finance apps don't allow for all features needed (budgeting/money transfer/review
            transactions)</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>Users of e-wallets need an interactive, entertaining way to improve their financial literacy
          because they are unable to manage their money well.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>3, 2, 1... Lift Off!
          The resulting web application, PlutoPay, gamifies the process of managing money to make it a
          more compelling habit. As users interact with the app, financial tips and information are
          provided as (optional) missions to be completed. Visual reinforcements and rewards are given
          when users make positive financial decisions, such as putting money into savings.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>Following the human-centered design process, tasks in each of the three phases were
          completed:</p>

      <div>
        <h1>Phase 1: Ideate</h1>
        <h2>Identifying the Audience</h2>
        <p>Applying my problem statement, I established the main target audience:</p>
        <h3>Teenagers Ages 13-19</h3>
        <p>The intent is to target those who are beginning to use and understand the value of money.
          Usually, by this age, youth begin to have an income and/or interact with money in some way.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>After identifying a problem and my target audience, I created user stories to articulate what
          target users would need to accomplish with an e-wallet application. Then I conducted an indepth
          competitive analysis on two e-wallet applications that were similar to my idea.</p>

        </picture>
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>I conducted user interviews with 6 participants that reflected both of my target audiences. My
          goals were to:
        <ul>
          <li>Explore users’ current method of money management, with a focus on pain points</li>
          <li>Learn about user experience/opinions with existing e-wallet applications</li>
          <li>Determine users’ desired goals regarding money management.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>With the data from my user interviews, I created two different user personas for PlutoPay.</p>

          </picture>
          <h3>Meet Liam</h3>
          <p>Liam, our main target user, is a 17-year-old high school senior who is less than a year away
            from moving off to college. He has a part-time job, but spends all his money on entertainment
            and food. He needs to start saving for college, but doesn’t know how to budget his money.</p>

          </picture>
          <h3>Meet Ava</h3>
          <p>Ava is a freshman in high school whose phone never leaves her hand. With profiles on basically
            every social media platform, she is constantly wanting to buy the next “hot, trendy” item.</p>

        <h1>Phase 2: Design</h1>
        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>After developing user personas, user flows were created to map out the process users would
          take through the app to complete their main tasks, which included creating a budget goal and
          transferring money.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes & Prototyping</h2>
        <p>Low-fidelity wireframes were hand-sketched, then translated into mid-fidelity wireframes using
          Adobe XD.</p>

        <p>Six participants completed moderated, in-person usability tests with the mid-fidelity prototype.
          Five out of six participants were able to successfully complete all of the given tasks, and 85%
          of participants rated the tasks as “Very Easy” to accomplish according to Lewis’ After-Scenario
          Questionnaire satisfaction metric. After testing, we were able to identify a few common errors
          experienced by participants.</p>

        <h2>UI Design</h2>
        <p>Using the Gestalt Laws of Grouping and Principles of Design, I updated several of my
          wireframes to improve the design, as well as edited them for accessibility.</p>

          <h2>Retrospective</h2>
          <p>This was a very exciting project to work on as a part of my User Experience Design certification course at CareerFoundry! I learned a lot about myself as a designer, including what my greatest strengths and weaknesses are, both
            creatively and technically. While I have some regrets, like wishing I asked more/better interview questions, I am very proud of the product I created!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>The next step for my project will be to develop the app for another user – parents and guardians of teens. An adult account is required for users under the age of 16, but adults are also encouraged to guide their children through their
            financial literacy journey. Special features on this type of account will include creating work/chore goals, setting spending limits, and more.</p>
