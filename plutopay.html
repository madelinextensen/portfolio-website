                            According to the National Financial Educators Council, the average financial literacy score for youth aged 10-14 is 57% and 63% for ages 15-18. Since youth are interacting with money at younger and younger ages,
                            how can we make learning about finances more appealing and develop more financially literate youth?<br />
                            <br />
                            The goal was to create an e-wallet application that teaches teens financial literacy in an interactive, entertaining way. It will encourage youth to take the initiative to manage their money and make healthy
                            financial decisions.

                                Greenlight is a well-established, widely-used competitor within the teen banking market, while Copper Banking is a new, highly-invested-in product. They each had great, but very different features. As I
                                mentioned was part of the problem with e-wallet apps, it was an either/or situation. What users want is an app that addresses all their financial needs and does so in a fun way.

                                It took me some time to hone the target audience. I initially started out with a target audience of 14-21-year-olds, as I wanted both teenagers and young adults to use the app. However, once I completed some
                                user research, I found that it would be better to target a younger, smaller audience to maximize the usefulness of the app.

                                Since I was designing my product for a very specific audience, I wanted to understand the way teens thought and behaved when it came to financial applications. I conducted user interviews with 6 participants,
                                half of which reflected my target audience. My goals were to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Explore users’ current method of money management, with a focus on pain points</li>
                                <li>Learn about user experience/opinions with existing e-wallet applications</li>

                        <br />
                        In regards to the interviews, I learned that teens are more likely to spend than save – and spend recklessly at that. Most teens also have no idea how to budget primarily because they have no need to since their
                        parents cover bills. And while teens may not have experience managing their money, they are very familiar with money transfer apps, such as Venmo and Cash App, which they frequently use to send and receive money
                        from friends and family.

                                could accomplish through PlutoPay.

                        changed, and more screens were added as they were transformed into mid-fidelity wireframes. <br />

                                Six participants completed moderated, in-person usability tests with the mid-fidelity prototype. <strong>Five out of six participants were able to complete all of the given tasks</strong>, and 85% of

                        When you think of a banking app, the word “fun” isn’t usually associated with it. As an app that is targeted towards teens aged 13-19, I wanted to create a product that was entertaining and visually intriguing while
                        also being educational and useful. The design for PlutoPay revolves around the theme of space, which provides an expanse of interesting elements to play around with and fun ways to illustrate concepts, including
                        delightful animations and rewarding interactions. <br />
                        <br />
                        Using the Gestalt Laws of Grouping and Principles of Design, I updated several of my wireframes to improve the design, as well as edited them to be accessible. Some changes included editing colors to be higher
                        contrast, adding symbols to alert users about errors (rather than relying on color), and adding effects to designate links. <br />
                        <br />
                        To keep the UI design of my app consistent, I created a style guide with elements such as typography, color palette, UI elements, language guidelines, and more. This is an important document that I and other
                        designers could use to reference when updating the app. I also developed the Design Language System for the app, an important document to make the handoff to other designers and developers easier.

                                While all of the peer feedback was constructive, and most of it was valuable, I had to decide which pieces of advice would benefit my app. I chose to iterate upon features that related mostly to navigational
                                ability and design specifics such as typography.

                            This was a very exciting project to work on as a part of my User Experience Design certification course at CareerFoundry! I learned a lot about myself as a designer, including what my greatest strengths and
                            weaknesses are, both creatively and technically. <br />
                            <br />
                            Some of the biggest lessons I encountered were:

                                <strong>Comparison is the thief of joy</strong> <br />
                                While working on this project, it was at times difficult not to compare my app to existing ones, especially because there were so few. I had to remember that my intent was not to recreate other app features
                                but to create an entirely new, engaging experience for users. Keeping my users in mind while designing PlutoPay helped hone my focus.

                                <strong>Are the users are always right?</strong> <br />
                                When completing user research there is much to be learned. While there were overarching or obvious issues that I encountered during user interviews, not all user complaints were necessary or worth being
                                solved. I identified the main pain points users had with e-wallets and addressed those through PlutoPay.

                                <strong>The work is never done</strong> <br />
                                As much as I would love it, perfection is never reached and products need to constantly evolve. Iterations were such a big part of making this a successful project, and even as I work on this case study, they
                                are still being made!

                        The next step for my project will be to develop the app for another user – parents and guardians of teens. An adult account is required for users under the age of 16, but adults are also encouraged to guide their
                        children through their financial literacy journey. Special features on this type of account will include creating work/chore goals, setting spending limits, and more.
